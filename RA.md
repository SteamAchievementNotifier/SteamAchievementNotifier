<h5 id="logfiles">Enabling log files</h5>

<details>
    <summary><h5 id="logfileinfo">‚Ñπ Why do I need to enable log files?</h5></summary>

> *In order to fetch achievement data quickly and efficiently, while preventing abuse of the **Retro Achievements API**, emulator game data (*such as current game status, unlocked achievement information etc.*) is fetched locally from a **log file** created by each supported emulator when *log-to-file* functionality is enabled.*
> 
> *This prevents making excessive and frequent calls to the **Retro Achievements API**, while allowing achievement data to be cached locally using only a few API calls. Additionally, user/achievement updates to the API are not instantaneous; even if aggressive API polling was implemented, any changes to user/achievement data take a while to display, resulting in severely delayed achievement data/in-app notifications for achievement unlocks.*
> 
> *Conversely, achievement unlock information is written to these log files at the exact point they are unlocked, which provides a quick, efficient and accurate method for tracking **Retro Achievements** unlocks.*
</details>

> ‚ö† ***Log-to-file** functionality is normally **not enabled** by default in any supported emulators, and requires the user to enable settings to do so.*

To enable *log-to-file* functionality:

<details>
    <summary>
    <h4 id="retroarch">RetroArch</h4>
    </summary>

- **RetroArch** > **Settings** > **Logging** must be configured with the following settings:

    - **Logging Verbosity**: *ON*
    - **Frontend Logging Level**: *1 (Info)*
    - **Log to File**: *ON*
    - **Timestamp Log Files**: *OFF*

> ‚ö† Enabling **Timestamp Log Files** will create a version of RetroArch's **log file** with a timestamped filename - e.g. `retroarch_2025_01_01__12_00_00.log`.
> 
> While technically possible to account for this dynamically, the system is designed to check for a single, static log file per supported emulator, so please ensure this option is disabled.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
    <h4 id="dolphin">Dolphin</h4>
    </summary>

- **Dolphin > View > Show Log Configuration** must be configured with the following settings:

    - **Verbosity**: *Info*
    - **Logger Outputs** > ‚òë *Write to File*
    - **Log Types** > ‚òë *Achievements (RetroAchievements)*
</details>

<details>

Once complete, this **log file** can then be selected in **Steam Achievement Notifier** for the associated emulator.

<h2 align="center" id="setup">IN-APP SETUP</h2>

Once [*log-to-file* functionality has been enabled](#logfiles), the emulator can then be enabled in **Steam Achievement Notifier** via **Settings** > **Retro Achievements** > **Emulators**.

<h5 id="selectlogfile">Selecting a log file</h5>

Once an emulator is enabled, a **Log File Path** option will appear. Click the üîé button to select the emulator's **log file** from the dialog:

<details>
    <summary>
    <h4>RetroArch</h4>
    </summary>

- Using default installation settings, `retroarch.log` is stored in:

    - `C:\RetroArch-x64\Logs`

> ‚ö† *Note: The location may differ depending on the user's chosen install location. Please choose the folder path applicable for your system.*
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
    <h4>Dolphin</h4>
    </summary>

- Using default installation settings, `dolphin.log` is stored in one of the following locations:

    - `%APPDATA%\Dolphin Emulator\Logs`
    - `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Dolphin Emulator\Logs`
    - üêß `$XDG_DATA_HOME/dolphin-emu/Logs`
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
    <h4>PCSX2 [Nightly]</h4>
    </summary>

> ‚ùó Due to recent updates, the contents of `emulog.txt` can currently only be accessed in the Nightly release of PCSX2

- Using default installation settings, `emulog.txt` is stored in:

    - `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\PCSX2\Logs`
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
    <h4>Duckstation</h4>
    </summary>

> ‚ùó `RA_Integration-x64.dll` must be [downloaded from the RetroAchievements website](https://retroachievements.org/bin/RA_Integration-x64.dll).
> 
> ‚ùó Once downloaded, `RA_Integration-x64.dll` must then be copied/moved to Duckstation's installation directory (*i.e. the same location as `duckstation-qt-x64-ReleaseLTCG.exe`*)

<details>
    <summary>
    <h5 id="duckstationdll">‚Ñπ What is RA_Integration-x64.dll?</h5>
    </summary>

> `RA_Integration-x64.dll` is a file used by developers to add RetroAchievements support to emulators, or for users of a supported emulator to create new achievements for existing games.
> 
> The DLL is created and maintained by RetroAchievements, and is hosted on their website (via the above link). It is safe to download and use, and the source code is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAIntegration).
> 
> Some emulators provide a way to load `RA_Integration-x64.dll` externally, which enables additional functionality within the emulator while requiring minimal setup.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
    <h5 id="duckstationdlluse">‚Ñπ Why do I need to use RA_Integration-x64.dll?</h5>
    </summary>

> While Duckstation's default log file (`duckstation.log`) is now accessible while the emulator is running due to recent updates, the information available within this file is currently inconsistent.
> 
> In `duckstation.log`'s current state, it does not provide enough reliable information regarding game/achievement events happening within the emulator, which prevents the ability for external applications (*such as Steam Achievement Notifier*) to implement a system to trigger in-app events (*such as notifications*) based on the current log events.
> 
> However, by making use of Duckstation's ***RAIntegration (Developer Only)*** option, `RA_Integration-x64.dll` can be loaded by Duckstation, which does a few important things:
> 
> - Creates a new folder called `RACache` in Duckstation's installation directory
> - Creates a file within `RACache` called `RALog.txt`
> - Logs ALL RetroAchievements achievement information, plus the current RA `gameId` and relevant game start/stop actions
> 
> By enabling `RA_Integration-x64.dll`, events logged to `RALog.txt` are now perfectly aligned with all other supported emulators and will work consistently, without having to implement any potentially unreliable workarounds
</details>

- Using default installation settings, `RALog.txt`\* is stored in:

    - `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Duckstation\RACache`\*

> ‚ö† \*`RACache/RALog.txt` will only be generated after adding `RA_Integration-x64.dll` and [enabling support in Duckstation](#logfiles)
</details>

<br>

<h5 id="notifications">Game Tracking/Achievement Notifications</h5>

Once the **log file** has been selected, run a game via the selected emulator.

Upon success, a **Now Tracking** notification will appear (*if **Settings** > **Notifications** > **Show Tracking Notification** is enabled*).

Once an achievement is unlocked, a notification with details of the unlocked achievement will display on-screen, including any previously configured customisations.

Additionally, status/game info will be displayed in **Steam Achievement Notifier** > **Settings** > **Retro Achievements**, along with a green dot indicator against the active emulator.
